    I had trouble inserting the databe the eunum values
    so I decided to remove them
    and make a db migration
    with flask db migrate -m "msg"
    flask db upgrade

    this command is to set teh auto increment field go back to 1 after deleting all rows on a table
    ALTER SEQUENCE "user_id_seq" RESTART WITH 1;

    I changed the route /api/user/<user_id>/profile to /api/user/profile/<user_id>

    when you define a relationship in SQLAlchemy. You can use the "backref" parameter to create a reverse direction to the relationship automatically.
    If you use "back_populates" parameter, you should specify the relationship on both sides.
