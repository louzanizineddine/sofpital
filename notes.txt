    I had trouble inserting the databe the eunum values
    so I decided to remove them
    and make a db migration
    with flask db migrate -m "msg"
    flask db upgrade

    this command is to set teh auto increment field go back to 1 after deleting all rows on a table
    ALTER SEQUENCE "user_id_seq" RESTART WITH 1;

    I changed the route /api/user/<user_id>/profile to /api/user/profile/<user_id>

    I create functions(to_dict, all,....) in utils.py file. These functions will be used across multiple models.

23.01.2024
    when a user visits his profile:
        => get all info about his account
        => get all posts(if learner) or get offers (if tutor)
        => get all meetings (done and future planned)

    when sending a data to update a profile we think there is no need to update all infos only modified one.

    i have finished emplementing all the routes and i have tested some of them. 
    for the routes that are related to post, offer, meeting models i did't test them because tables are empty.

    we must handle errors while sign up
    and hashpasswords before inserting
    we must make sure when we delete a user every record related has to be deleted also ????
    we must improve the function get all learners

    search ??
    GET api/search/<query>: we search anything that could match the query
    filter ?? for every model:
    pagination
    file upload
    user image

    for the problem of deletion i think i solve it you can check and test it. 
    if i delete learner or tutor is all the meetings related to them has to be deleted!!!!?

    I implemented checks for the registration. I don't know if I do them all or I forget something to check.
    hashpasswords is done (I hope it is correct).

    we make sure when we recommend a post for a tutor it does not recommend a post he already made an offer to

10.02.2024

11.02.2024

19.02.2024
    better layout for in tutor space
    post input for learner to be improved
    We can not show the post as recommendation if the tutor already made an offer.
