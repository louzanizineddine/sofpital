    I had trouble inserting the databe the eunum values
    so I decided to remove them
    and make a db migration
    with flask db migrate -m "msg"
    flask db upgrade

    this command is to set teh auto increment field go back to 1 after deleting all rows on a table
    ALTER SEQUENCE "user_id_seq" RESTART WITH 1;

    I changed the route /api/user/<user_id>/profile to /api/user/profile/<user_id>

    I create functions(to_dict, all,....) in utils.py file. These functions will be used across multiple models.

    when a user visits his profile:
        => get all info about his account
        => get all posts(if learner) or get offers (if tutor)
        => get all meetings (done and future planned)

    when sending a data to update a profile we think there is no need to update all infos only modified one.

    i have finished emplementing all the routes and i have tested some of them. 
    for the routes that are related to post, offer, meeting models i did't test them because tables are empty.
